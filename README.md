## <h2><samp> üí¨ Introduction  </samp></h2>

This project is a database designed with well-defined relationships between tables, and a subsequently developed REST API that meet the next objectives and specified requirements for the management of the Consejo General de Colegios de Administradores de Fincas, with Node.js and Express technologies, coupled with MongoDB/Mongoose within robust REST API for an online management application.

Opted in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in structuring our project it is driven to achieve an efficient and visually organized application. The MVC architecture divides our system into three key components: the Model, responsible for managing data and implementing business logic; the View, handling visual representation and user interface; and the Controller, managing control logic and user interaction.

## ‚ö° Objectives 

- Admin area: Administrators possess the capability to efficiently manage users and create certificates. 

- Management and Certificate Creation: Leveraging collaboration with full-stack and data teams, the platform facilitates the conversion of certificates into PDFs for a professional resume format. Additionally, the system ensures accessibility by generating audio versions of certificates.
  
- User area: In the user area, participants have the functionality to upload and report incidents, ensuring a transparent and responsive approach to addressing any issues that may arise.

- Efficiency through Automation: Administrative tasks are automated, enabling administrators and users to save valuable time and resources. This automation allows them to focus on creating memorable events and enhancing overall efficiency.


## üöÄ Structure
The choice to structure our project using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is based on the pursuit of an efficient and visually organized approach for our application. MVC divides the application into three core components: the Model, responsible for data management and business logic; the View, handling visual representation and the user interface; and the Controller, managing control logic and user interaction. 

This separation of responsibilities not only simplifies collaborative development but also enhances maintainability by enabling developers to work on specific parts of the project without affecting the whole. Furthermore, it facilitates code reuse, potentially speeding up development, and ensures that the application is scalable and adaptable as it evolves, resulting in a more robust and visually appealing final product. 

Ultimately, the choice of MVC contributes to a more efficient and successful development experience for our project.


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

### Front-end dependencies

These are the front-end dependencies used in the project, along with brief explanations of their roles and how to install them.

**React**

React is a widely adopted and extensively used JavaScript library in the web development world. React simplifies the creation of user interfaces by offering a structured and efficient way to build interactive web applications. It focuses on building reusable UI components that efficiently update and render when data changes. React is known for its performance, developer-friendly tools, and the ability to create single-page applications (SPAs).

```
npm install react
``` 

**Redux**

Redux is a predictable state management library commonly used in JavaScript applications, particularly with frameworks like React. It helps manage the state of your application in a predictable and efficient way, making it easier to develop complex user interfaces and handle data flow.

```
npm @reduxjs/toolkit
``` 


**Vite**

Vite is a build tool and development server that is designed to make modern web development faster and more efficient. It is often used for building JavaScript and TypeScript-based web applications, particularly with frameworks like Vue.js and React.

```
npm install vite
```

**AntDesign**

AntDesign is a popular and highly customizable component library for building user interfaces in React. It is designed to make it easy for developers to create beautiful and accessible UIs while maintaining flexibility and extensibility.

```
npm install antd
```

**Axios**

Axios is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests from web browsers or Node.js applications. It provides a clean and straightforward API for sending HTTP requests and handling responses. Axios is commonly used in web development for tasks like fetching data from a server, sending data to a server, or interacting with APIs.

```
npm install axios
```


**react-dom**

react-dom is a package in the React ecosystem that provides the necessary tools and methods for rendering React components in web applications. It specifically focuses on rendering React components into the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. Here are some key features and concepts related to react-dom.

```
npm install react-dom

```

**react-router-dom**

react-router-dom is a popular JavaScript library for adding client-side routing and navigation to React applications. It allows you to create single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views and navigation between them without the need for full-page reloads. Here are some key features and concepts related to react-router-dom.

```
npm install react-router-dom

```

**Sass - (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)**

Sass is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of regular CSS. It adds features and functionality that make it easier to write and maintain stylesheets for web development. Sass is widely used in web development projects to improve the efficiency and organization of CSS code. Here are some key features and concepts related to Sass. 

```
npm install sass
```
